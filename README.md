# ufo_data_analytics
Data cleaning and mining for the incredibly messy NUFORC public dataset.\n
Contains tokenized/vectorized sentences for NLP analysis, since most information comes from the text accounts.\n
Working on some GIS tagging for particular words to see if UFO encounter reports vary geographically.\n
Just for fun! :)

You'll need to use the NUFORC dataset for this, which you can find a mildly-cleaned version at https://data.world/timothyrenner/ufo-sightings
